# HttpInterface-springboot3
This is  simple project that I created to help learn and understand how to use the declarative Http Interface introduced as from spring 6 and Springboot 3.
In this priject I have created 4 different services, implemented Eureka Server for service registry. The other three services serve as client.
Student service has been used to make http client calls ti the other two services ( Book Service and Product Service).

Feel free to clone the project and experiment it yourself. Personally, while on it I realized it's easier and helps reduce the boiler plate from the other http clients (RestTemplate).
Happy coding!
